# Types of Deep Learning

Two types of deep learning models:

- discriminative
- generative


## Discriminative
- used to classify or predict
- typically trained on a dataset of labeled data
- learn the relationships between the features of the data points and the label


## Generative

- generates new data that is similar to data it was trained on
- understands the _distribution_ of data and how likely it a given example is
- predict next word in a sequence

## Example


Discriminative technique can predict whether an image is a dog or cat.

Generative technique can generate a picture of a dog.

## TLDR

Generative model can generate new data instances, while discriminative model discriminate between different kind of data instances.
