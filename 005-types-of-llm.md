# Types of LLM


There are 3 kinds of LLM, each needs prompting in a different way


- generic (or raw): these predicts the next word (technically token) based on the language in the training data
- instruction tuned: trained to predict a response to the instructions given in the input
- dialog tuned: trained to have a dialog by predicting the next response
